# DevilDaggersShaders

## Shader packs

### Original

This shader pack contains the original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files.

### Optimized

This shader pack contains the original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files, but with improved readability. Unused functions, unused parameters, and commented code is removed in this pack. All code is also correctly indented and symmetric.

## Editing shaders

It is recommended to open the solution using Visual Studio 2019 and install the [GLSL Language Integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielScherzer.GLSL).

## Modifying the Devil Daggers resource files

Extracting and modifying the game's assets (audio, models, textures, shaders, and particles) can be done using [Devil Daggers Asset Editor](https://devildaggers.info/Tools/DevilDaggersAssetEditor).
