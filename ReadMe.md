# DevilDaggersShaders

## Shader packs

### Original

The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files.

### Optimized

The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files, but with improved readability. Unused functions, unused parameters, and commented code was removed. All code is also correctly indented and symmetric.

## Editing shaders

It is recommended to open the solution using Visual Studio 2019 and install the [GLSL Language Integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielScherzer.GLSL).

## Modifying the Devil Daggers resource files

Modding the game's assets can be done using [Devil Daggers Asset Editor](https://devildaggers.info/Tools/DevilDaggersAssetEditor).
