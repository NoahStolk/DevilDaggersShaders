# Devil Daggers Shaders

## Shader packs

- Original: The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files.
- Optimized: The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files, but with all of their redundancy removed (unused functions, parameters, commented code). All code is also correctly indented and symmetric.

## Editing shaders

It is recommended to open the solution using Visual Studio 2019 and install the [GLSL Language Integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielScherzer.GLSL).

## Modifying the Devil Daggers resource files

Modding the game's assets can be done using [Devil Daggers Asset Editor](https://devildaggers.info/Tools/DevilDaggersAssetEditor).
