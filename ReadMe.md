# Devil Daggers Shaders

## Shader packs

- Original: The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files.
- Optimized: The original shaders extracted from the Devil Daggers resource files, but with all of their redundancy removed (unused functions, parameters, commented code). All code is also correctly indented and symmetric.

It is recommended to open the solution using Visual Studio 2019 and install the [GLSL Language Integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielScherzer.GLSL).
